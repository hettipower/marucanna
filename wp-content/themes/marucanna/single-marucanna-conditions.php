                <h3>Definition ofÂ chronic <span>pain</span></h3>

                <p>Any discomfort that lasts longer than three months is considered chronic. Pain can be an unpleasant physical or mental sensation brought on by a real or potential physical injury.</p>

                <p>Long-lasting knee discomfort is one instance of chronic pain. To control the knee discomfort, you might need to take medications or engage in regular activity.</p>

                <p>There is a clear, continuous cause of discomfort for some people. Others' pain may no longer have a clear source or may have never had one. Each person's pain should be treated differently since it is as distinct as they are.</p>

                <h3>What brings about chronic pain?</h3>

                <p>What are some typical reasons for persistent pain? <br/>Chronic pain has a wide variety of common causes. Back discomfort and other joint, muscle, and bone conditions like arthritis are examples of these. Some other causes of chronic pain include surgery, cancer, and nerve damage.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms of chronic pain</h3>

                <p>What are some typical signs of persistent pain? <br/> The following are typical signs of chronic pain:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The pain is dull, throbbing, and localised.</li>
                    <li>The occasional acute ache that comes on suddenly</li>
                    <li>Numbness or tingling in the region</li>
                    <li>Pain makes it difficult to walk.</li>
                    <li>Being unable to get a good night's sleep due to the pain</li>
                    <li>The worsening of the discomfort with particular motions</li>
                    <li>Persistent discomfort that requires medicine in order to function throughout the day</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The way you deal with chronic pain is particular to you. Pain may be persistent or intermittent. You could discover that there are particular triggers that might make your discomfort worse. A flare-up is the medical term for this unexpected increase in pain.</p>

                <p>Some people with chronic pain experience neuropathic symptoms. Strange feelings like this might be the result of nerve damage. In places where people experience discomfort, it is frequently characterised as a burning, tingling, or numb sensation.</p>

                    <div class="description">
                        <p>There is little research on how medical cannabis affects chronic pain. On the other hand, more people are looking into medicinal cannabis now that it was legalised for medical use in 2018. Medical cannabis may be taken into consideration as a treatment option for chronic pain if first-line medications have not been successful in symptom reduction.</p>

            <p>Chronic pain can be treated with a wide range of drugs, including those bought over-the-counter from a pharmacy. Pharmacies in the UK provide what are known as "over-the-counter" medicines; supermarkets offer these as well. Below are a few examples of these:</p>
